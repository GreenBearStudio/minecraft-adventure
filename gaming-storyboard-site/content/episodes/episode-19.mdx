## Time to Check on the Village.. just don't eat rotten flesh near the clerics..

After the chaos of yesterday’s animal parade — pigs squealing, cows mooing, sheep bleating, horses neighing, and all of them crammed into one tiny room because Hunjvo forgot to build the actual animal house — our hero felt a little guilty.

He wanted to make sure the villagers were okay.

He wanted to show them he meant no harm.

He wanted to prove he wasn’t always a walking disaster.

So Hunjvo marched down the snowy path toward the village, determined to be on his best behavior.

## The New Kid on the Block

When he arrived, the villagers were already whispering about him.

Some peeked from behind doors.

Some hid behind hay bales.

The clerics pinched their noses dramatically.

But then Hunjvo spotted someone new.

A tiny villager child with a square head, square arms, square legs — well, everything was square, but this kid somehow looked extra square.

“This is Blocky,” said one villager proudly.

The narrator sighed.

“How original…”

Hunjvo blinked.
“But… everything is blocky here. Why is that name special?”

The narrator froze.

Hunjvo had heard him.

Or… had he?

Hunjvo looked around, confused.
“What is this weird voice? Why does it ask such strange questions?”

The villagers stared at him, then at each other.

Was Hunjvo talking to himself?

Was he hearing things?

Was he… cursed?

Blocky, the new kid, simply tilted his head and stared at Hunjvo with big, curious eyes.

He didn’t run away.

He didn’t scream.

He didn’t hide.

He just said, “Hi.”

And for a moment, Hunjvo forgot all about the animal chaos, the cramped room full of livestock, and the villagers’ fear.

He smiled back.

“Hi, Blocky.”

The narrator watched quietly, wondering — not for the first time — what truly went on inside Hunjvo’s mind.
And whether Hunjvo would ever figure out where that mysterious voice came from.

But that was a mystery for another day.
