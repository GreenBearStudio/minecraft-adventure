## Hunger for Adventure

After many peaceful hours staring at the maps in his Map Room, Hunjvo felt something stirring inside him. A restlessness. A spark. A hunger for adventure that no bread, beet, or potato could satisfy.

“I will explore the Overworld inch by inch and uncover the mysteries!” he declared proudly.

The narrator whispered, “Just be careful, Hunjvo…”  
But Hunjvo was already gone.

He leapt onto Burr, his loyal horse, and galloped off toward the horizon.
Did he pack food?
Did he bring boots?
A shovel?
Anything?

…Probably not.
But off he went anyway.

## The Journey to the Water’s Edge

Hunjvo rode until the land ended in a wide, shimmering lake. He tied Burr to a fence post, built a tiny sleeping hut for him (complete with hay and a torch), and gave him a pat on the nose.

“Stay here, Burr. I’ll be back!”

Then Hunjvo hopped into a boat and paddled across the water.
Days passed.
Nights passed.
He hummed, he drifted, he occasionally panicked when he thought he saw a drowned zombie, but eventually—

## A New Village… and Another Portal

A village appeared on the shore.
And beside it…
Another portal.

Cracked.
Ancient.
Purple energy flickering faintly.

“What are these things?” Hunjvo wondered.
He needed answers.
He needed knowledge.
He needed… a librarian.

## Hunjvo the Thiefy Visitor

Hunjvo sprinted into the village like a whirlwind.
Doors flew open.
Chests rattled.
Villagers screamed.
Some ran away, convinced an Illager raid had begun.

The iron golem?
Fast asleep in a flower patch.
Snoring.
Completely useless.

Seeing the golem snoozing peacefully, the villagers hesitated.
If this strange intruder were dangerous, surely the golem would wake up… right?

Hunjvo, meanwhile, was already picking locks on chests.

“Ooo, what’s this?”

“Shiny!”

“Potato!”

“More potato!”

"Apples!"

“A blacksmith—let’s see what he has!”

## Making Friends (Sort Of)

Eventually, Hunjvo realized he should probably try to make friends instead of causing panic.
So he handed out bread.
And beets.
Lots of beets.

The villagers stared at the red roots in confusion.
Hunjvo took a big bite to demonstrate.
They cautiously tried them too.

“Ooo, nice!” said one villager.
“I prefer bread,” said Farmer Bibbie.

But they smiled.
They accepted him.
They even waved goodbye when he left.

## Home Again

After many days, Hunjvo returned to the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.
He tied up his boat, reunited with Burr, and climbed the snowy mountain path home.

<AssetImage name="d234_SideViewFortress.png" />

He was tired.
He was hungry.
He was excited.

Because the world was big.
The portals were mysterious.
And Hunjvo knew—deep in his heart—that many more adventures were waiting for him just beyond the next hill.

And he was ready.
