## Hunger.. and a Garden?

After finishing the towering, terrifying, cloud‑scraping watchtower, Hunjvo finally decided it was time to rest. He plopped down on a stone block, sighed happily… and then his stomach growled so loudly that even the phantoms circling above paused mid‑screech.

Hunjvo blinked.
“Oh. I’m hungry.”

The narrator groaned.
“Hunjvo… if only you had a lot of food. If only there were a way to grow food. If only—”

Hunjvo gasped dramatically.
“A garden!”

And so began the Greenhouse Project of Fluffy Socks.

## Borrowing (Not Stealing… Right, Hunjvo?)

Hunjvo needed seeds. And vegetables. And dirt. And more vegetables.
So he did what any responsible, totally‑not‑a‑thief hero would do:
  
<ChoiceBlock
  prompt="What do you pack for the.. not-uhmm-thief-adventure?"
  choices={[
    { label: "A donkey and a.. boat?", content: <>Uhmmm.. <AssetImage name="d231_DonkeyBoat.png" /> </> },
    { label: "Just GO! Run!", content: <>Go, go, go! Hunjvo! </> }
  ]}
/>

He sprinted into the nearby village at dawn and jumped straight into the villagers’ gardens.

He grabbed beets.
He grabbed wheat.
He grabbed potatoes (his favorite).
He grabbed seeds.
He grabbed everything.

The villagers, just waking up, stepped outside to greet the morning sun… and instead found their gardens flattened, uprooted, and absolutely destroyed.

The narrator stared.
“Hunjvo… how could you?”

Hunjvo froze mid‑potato‑munch.
He felt bad.
He really did.

So he rebuilt the gardens.
Perfectly.
Neatly.
Lovingly.

He kept all the food, of course.
But the gardens looked great again, so… progress?

## The Map Room of Adventures

Back at the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, Hunjvo got to work.
He built a greenhouse—warm, cozy, and protected from the endless mountain snow.
He planted everything he “borrowed.”
He watered it.
He admired it.

Then he expanded the fortress even more.

He built a Map Room, where he documented every adventure he had been on so far.
The snowy village.
The taiga village.
The portal of purple whispers.
The caves.
The mountains.
The rivers.

He pinned maps to the walls, connecting them into a grand tapestry of the world.
“What adventures have yet to be?” he wondered.

## The Stables of Many Hooves

Next, he built a stable.
A big one.
A fancy one.

Inside he placed his horses:
• Jazz  
• Hicup  
• Burr
• (Goie wandered in the middle of the night, because Hunjvo didn't put a lead on! Oh well..)

And his loyal donkey:
• Lund

They all brayed happily as Hunjvo filled the stable with hay and torches and more hay.

## A Night Ride… Of Course

Then, because he is Hunjvo, he decided to take Burr for a ride.
At night.
Of course.

The narrator sighed deeply.
“We should have guessed.”

Hunjvo trotted proudly into the darkness, humming to himself.
The moon glowed.
The snow sparkled.
The world was peaceful.

Until—

SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS—

“WATCH OUT FOR THAT CREEPER!”
