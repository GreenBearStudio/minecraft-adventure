## Another Snowy Walk.. at Night?!

Hunjvo left the snowy village with a full belly and a happy heart. The cheerful sounds of the villagers faded behind him as he skipped along the snowy path, humming to himself.

Night crept in. Again.

## The Legion of Running, Screaming, and yes Fighting

“HUNJVO! Why do you forget to look at the sky and see that the sun is setting and night is coming!” the Narrator yelled, exasperated.

But Hunjvo, undisturbed, kept skipping, thinking about Smally’s delicious cookie.
“Oh what a delicious cookie it wa—”

WHOOSH.  
An arrow of slowness zipped past his head.

WHOOSH.  
Another.

THWACK.  
The third hit him squarely in the butt — the exact same spot the Stray had shot long ago in the basement of the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.

Hunjvo froze. Then panicked.
“AHHHH! NOT AGAIN!”

He ran in circles, arms flailing, legs wobbling from the slowness effect. Strays emerged from the darkness, their icy bows glinting under the moon.

## The Portal

But then — out of the corner of his eye — he saw it.

An abandoned portal.
Tall. Majestic. Purple energy swirling faintly between cracked obsidian blocks. It whispered of ancient knowledge, forgotten realms, treasures beyond the overworld.

Another arrow whizzed past.

“NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO DREAM OF WORLDS BEYOND OUR OWN!” shrieked both Hunjvo and the Narrator in perfect, terrified harmony.

The Strays closed in. Hunjvo gripped his sword.
He fought.

## The Battle that was not Recorded!.. WHY!? oh why..

And what a battle it was.
Arrows flew. Bones clattered. Hunjvo dodged, rolled, yelped, and swung wildly. The Strays were too many, too fast, too icy — and the unseen Narrator was so overwhelmed by the chaos that he forgot to take a recording.

“WHY, NARRATOR, WHY?!” Hunjvo yelled mid‑battle.
Oh right… that’s me, the Narrator muttered.

But when the sun finally rose, the Strays burned away or fled into the shadows. Hunjvo stood victorious, panting, bruised, and rubbing his poor arrow‑targeted butt.

## Aftermath, Calmness and a Locked Chest

Then he noticed it.

Near the portal, half-buried in snow, was a treasure box.
Old. Mysterious. Locked with strange markings.

Hunjvo stepped closer, heart pounding.

The portal hummed softly behind him, as if waiting.

And the adventure — whatever it was — had only just begun.
