## What to do Today?

Hunjvo woke up the next morning in the Fortress of Fluffy Socks with a sparkle in his eyes and a bounce in his step. The sun peeked over the snowy peaks, lighting up the stone walls he had spent so many days shaping.

“What adventures await our bright‑eyed Hunjvo today?!” the narrator wondered dramatically.

Hunjvo stretched, yawned, and replied, “Time to expand, time to build, time to minecraft!”

The narrator sighed.
“Hunjvo… I thought you wanted to adventure today.”

But Hunjvo had long since decided the narrator was just his own subconscious mumbling at him, so he brushed it off and marched outside with purpose.

## The Lava Pit of Mystery

For many days, Hunjvo worked tirelessly. He expanded walls, reinforced towers, and—somehow—built a lava pit.

Where did he find the lava?
The narrator had no idea.
Hunjvo didn’t explain.
He just grinned and said, “It was there.”

At the bottom of the pit, he placed cauldrons to catch the dripping lava. Soon he would have enough to fuel a grand foundry—a smelting powerhouse for all the iron, copper, and gold he mined from the mountains.

Gold especially.
Hunjvo loved gold.
He didn’t know what to do with it yet, but it was shiny, so that was enough.

## Nightfall at the Fortress

When night came, the world outside the fortress changed. The howls of zombies echoed through the valley. Strays crept through the snow, their icy arrows glinting in the moonlight. Creepers lurked in the shadows, hissing softly. Witches cackled somewhere in the dark, brewing trouble.

And sometimes—
Phantoms.

They swooped high above the fortress, screeching as they circled the towers Hunjvo had built. Their wings cast eerie shadows across the snowy courtyard.

But Hunjvo kept working.
Torch by torch.
Block by block.
Wall by wall.

The Fortress of Fluffy Socks grew taller, stronger, stranger, and more magnificent with every passing day.

And though the monsters howled and the phantoms shrieked, Hunjvo stood firm.
He was building something grand.
Something lasting.
Something that would one day welcome villagers, friends, and maybe even a few polar bears (as long as they didn’t eat all his food again).

The night was dark, but Hunjvo’s fortress glowed bright—
a beacon of determination, chaos, and fluffy socks.
