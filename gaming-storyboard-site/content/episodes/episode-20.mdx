After playing hide‑and‑seek with Blocky (and losing seven out of seven times), Hunjvo needed a break. Blocky was simply too good at hiding — behind hay bales, under beds, inside barrels, even on top of the bell tower somehow. Hunjvo’s brain was spinning.

So he wandered through the village to clear his mind.

The sun was warm.

The breeze was gentle.

The river sparkled invitingly.

“Oh wow, time for a relaxing swim!” the narrator thought.

Before the narrator could even finish the thought, SPLASH!

Hunjvo launched himself into the water like a very enthusiastic penguin.

The villagers gasped.

The narrator panicked.

Blocky giggled from behind a composter.

Under the water, Hunjvo kicked his legs happily. But then he remembered something the villagers had told him:

“Beware the drowned — the zombified mer‑zombie‑steve‑like zombies! Some even throw tridents!”

Hunjvo’s eyes widened.

He spun around in the water.

He squinted into the depths.

Nothing.

Just fish.

And bubbles.

And his own reflection looking slightly confused.

Still, the thought of underwater mysteries filled him with excitement.

What secrets lay beneath the waves?

Sunken ruins?

Hidden treasure?

A drowned with a shiny trident?

A whole underwater world waiting for him?

The narrator whispered softly, “Just don’t forget to breathe…”  
He whispered it very quietly, afraid Hunjvo might hear him again and panic.

But Hunjvo only floated on his back, staring at the sky, dreaming of future ocean adventures.

One day, he would explore the deep.

One day, he would uncover the secrets of the drowned.

One day, he would build a boat big enough for Burr, Jazz, Hicup, Lund, and maybe even Happy the polar bear.

But for now…

He just enjoyed the swim.
