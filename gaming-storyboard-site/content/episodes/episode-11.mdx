## Time to Think... about adventure :)

After returning home to the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, Hunjvo felt refreshed and ready for more adventure. The snowy winds around his mountain home whispered of distant places, and Hunjvo—always eager, always curious—decided it was time to explore the surrounding landscapes once more.

One fine morning, he skipped happily down the mountain path, humming to himself. He thought about the snowy village he had visited, about little Smally, and about the mysterious portal he had discovered days earlier. “Maybe I’ll go back today,” he thought.

But Hunjvo’s feet had other plans.

## Wandering... the Hunjvo way

He wandered off the path, humming louder, distracted by a butterfly, a funny-shaped tree, and a rock that looked suspiciously like a potato.

“Oh Hunjvo, don’t you know you might get lost?” wondered the narrator.

But Hunjvo had a compass!
A trusty, reliable, absolutely essential compass that—

SPLASH.

Hunjvo stared at the river.
The river stared back.

His compass sank.

Without hesitation, Hunjvo dove in after it, arms flailing, bubbles everywhere. After a frantic scramble, he emerged victorious, compass in hand.
“Oh wow,” sighed the narrator. “No more scares, Hunjvo.”

## The Village

But then—
“Wait… what is that?”

Ahead, nestled between towering spruce trees, was a taiga village.

It was bursting with life. Villagers in long fluffy coats bustled about, tending to their homes and farms. Snow foxes darted between fences. And an iron golem patrolled the streets, its eyes glowing with suspicion the moment it spotted Hunjvo.

To the golem, Hunjvo looked… questionable.
Possibly Illager-ish.
Definitely chaotic.

But Hunjvo paid no heed. He ran freely through the village, waving at everyone, occasionally (and very randomly) barging into houses and stealing bread from their chests.

## The Thief... wait it's Hunjvo? Why oh why?

The narrator watched in horror.
“Hunjvo… no… stop… HUNJVO!”

But Hunjvo was already chewing.

Out of the corner of the narrator’s eye, the iron golem began to follow. Slowly. Methodically. Its eyes narrowed with every loaf Hunjvo pocketed. Every carrot. Every potato. Every suspiciously unattended pumpkin pie.

By the time Hunjvo skipped out of the last house, crumbs on his face, the golem’s eyes were glowing a deep, furious red.

“Perhaps next time,” the narrator sighed, “if Hunjvo visits, the villagers and their iron guardian won’t be so friendly.”

For now, Hunjvo had earned a new title in the taiga village:

Hunjvo the Bread Thief.

Hunjvo why?!
