## More Cave Diving?!

The caves stretched deeper into the mountain, and Hunjvo pressed on, pickaxe in hand. He stumbled upon a grand waterfall, moonlight spilling through a crack in the stone above. The water shimmered in shades of blue, cascading into the depths.

Hunjvo stood mesmerized. “Such peace… wow, would be nice to ride that water down to where it goes deeper into the cave,” he mused, forgetting entirely that it was night. The moon’s glow enchanted him, and his guard slipped.

## The Copper Zombie.. Hunjvo called him Fred.. poor Fred

Suddenly, a groan echoed. From the shadows lurched a Zombie clad in copper armor.

“Ahhahaa!” both Hunjvo and the Zombie cried at once, startling each other. The narrator muttered, “I’m not sure if it was Hunjvo’s yelp or the Zombie, both seemed scared of seeing the other.”

The Zombie jumped up and down, confused, as if trying to flee. But then it remembered — it was a Zombie.

## Enough Talk. Time to Fight!

“Do Zombies have a brain to think with? They must,” Hunjvo said, tightening his grip. With a leap, he attacked. The copper-clad foe was no match. His sword struck true, and the creature fell, puffing away into smoke.

## Well, we did say FIGHT!

Triumphant, Hunjvo sprinted toward the cave entrance. But danger was not done. Two Zombie villagers, drawn by the clash, ambushed him in the tunnel. Their groans rose, their arms outstretched.

Hunjvo’s senses sharpened. He spun, charged, and struck with swift precision. The battle was quick, decisive. Both fell, their cries fading into silence.

Breathing hard, Hunjvo wiped his brow. The waterfall still roared behind him, moonlight still shimmered, but the night had reminded him: beauty and danger walked hand in hand in the mountain’s depths.
