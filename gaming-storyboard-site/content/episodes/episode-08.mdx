## The Start of a Village Expansion

After so many nights in the caves, Hunjvo longed for sunlight. He wandered into the village, breathing in the crisp air, enjoying the calmness of the open sky.

The villagers were busy — with Hunjvo’s help, they had begun expanding the settlement. New plots were marked for farmers, fishermen, and even plans for a librarian and a shepherd. The village hummed with hope, its future growing alongside the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.

Let's take a look around the village with Hunjvo.

## Hunjvo and his Questions about the World.. well just don't bother the clerics

But Hunjvo, ever curious, asked endless questions. The farmers gossiped, the fishermen shrugged, and the clerics… well, they kept running away. They whispered that Hunjvo was strange, that he didn’t appreciate the fine art of potion brewing. Worse, they wrinkled their noses and muttered that he was too stinky — a side effect of his habit of eating rotten zombie flesh.

The narrator sighed. “I tried asking Hunjvo to eat more carrots, but he has a lot of rotten flesh… so oh well.”

Still, the villagers tolerated him, for his strength and his endless energy. And though Hunjvo smelled faintly of the undead, he was their builder, their protector, and their friend. The village would grow, and perhaps one day, even the clerics would stop running away. Though maybe not..

## A Boating Adventure.. well it was short

The villagers, grateful for his help in expanding their homes, granted Hunjvo access to one of their docks. With excitement, he loaded a small boat with a chest and set sail across the lake. The water shimmered under the sun, and for a moment, Hunjvo felt like a great explorer.

But the lake was small. Too small. Within minutes, he had reached the opposite shore. Looking back, Hunjvo saw the Village in the distance.

## Map of the Beyond.. uh maybe not a bad idea

As he walked back toward the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, Hunjvo’s mind raced. He realized he needed more than just tunnels and walls — he needed a map. A way to orient himself, to know where he was, and where he could go exploring farther into the great beyond.

He imagined charting rivers, valleys, and mountains, marking dangerous caves and friendly villages. The map would guide him, but it would also remind him of his duty: to keep building his fortress and expanding the village.

The sun was setting, but Hunjvo did manage to scribble some notes and sketches. The villagers watching him, were shaking their heads at his endless energy. To them, Hunjvo was strange, but he was also their builder, their protector, and their dreamer.

And so, with a chest full of supplies and a head full of plans, Hunjvo prepared to chart the world — one step, one tunnel, one fortress wall at a time.
