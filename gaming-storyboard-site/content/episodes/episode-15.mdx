## The Watchtower Dream

Hunjvo, ever the dreamer, stood atop the snowy courtyard of the Fortress of Fluffy Socks and gazed out over the valley. The wind brushed past him, carrying the scent of pine and adventure.

“I need a watchtower,” he declared proudly.
“A tall one! A super tall one! One that lets me see everything!”

The narrator hesitated.
“But Hunjvo… aren’t you afraid of heights? Oh well, I guess you already live on top of a mountain so it shouldn’t be bad… right?”

That last part was more of a mumble. Hunjvo didn’t hear it.
Or maybe he did.
Or maybe he ignored it.
One could only wonder what goes on inside the mind of our hero.

## Higher... higher... higher...

Hunjvo began building.
Then mining.
Then building again.

Up he went.
Higher.
Higher.
Higher.

“Hunjvo this is becoming too scary even for me!” the narrator yelped.
But Hunjvo kept stacking stone bricks like a man possessed.

The tower rose into the sky, scraping the clouds, wobbling slightly in the wind.

## Nightfall... and trouble

Then—of course—it became night.
Because Hunjvo never checks the sky.

The undead emerged.
Zombies groaned.
Creepers hissed.
Strays rattled their icy bones.

“Hunj… lo—” the narrator tried to warn him.

Too late.

    Hunjvo slipped.
    He fell.
    He hit the ground with a thud that echoed through the valley. </> }

/>

“OH WOW that was close again!” cried the narrator.

The undead closed in.
Hunjvo scrambled to his feet, panicking. The Fortress was below him, he didn't know what to do.

<AssetImage name="d217_TopViewOfFortress.png" />

Fight?
Hide?
Run?

He chose… hide.
(Which was honestly the smartest thing he’d done all night.)

He dove under a pile of stone bricks he had placed earlier, curled up like a terrified potato, eyes wide and shimmering with fear.

“And don’t eat the zombie flesh—eat some bread instead!” the narrator scolded from somewhere above.

## Dawn

When the sun finally rose, the zombies burned away, the creepers wandered off, and the valley grew quiet again.

“Hunjvo? HUNJVO? Where are you?”

A small whimper came from beneath the bricks.

There he was.
Shaking.
Dusty.
Alive.

“Well, Hunjvo… I told you it would be scary.”

But Hunjvo crawled out, brushed off the dirt, and looked up at the half‑finished tower with renewed determination.

<AssetImage name="d218_TallTowerOnMountain.png" />

He was scared.
He was exhausted.
He was probably still hungry.

But he was Hunjvo.
And Hunjvo always continues on again.
