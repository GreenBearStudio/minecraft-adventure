## Tales of an Unknown Darkness Beneath the Mountain

Adventurous and restless, Hunjvo set out to explore deeper into the mountain. Earlier that day, he had visited the village, where a cartographer spoke of the wonders of the world — the far reach of the oceans, and the darkness beneath the mountains where the Fortress of Fluffy Socks stood. The villagers shivered at the mention of it, their eyes full of fear.

But Hunjvo was determined. He packed torches, tightened his boots, and descended into the unknown.

## Echoes of the Deep Dark

The cave he found was narrow at first, then widened into twisting passages. He placed torches carefully, one by one, determined not to be ambushed by Zombies, Creepers, or whatever else the villagers were too afraid to name. Days blurred into nights as he pressed deeper, the silence broken only by the drip of water and the echo of his footsteps.

Then he saw it.

A strange substance clung to the walls and floor — slimy, gooey, and unsettling. Its dark, bluish color seemed to pulse with eerie energy. Whenever Hunjvo moved, faint lights flickered across its surface, as though the cave itself was watching him.

## The Failing Courage but Shinny Stuff Ahead?

His courage faltered. He gripped his torch tighter, heart pounding. “What is this…?” he whispered, too afraid to speak louder.

He crept forward, just enough to peek into the abyss beyond. And there — half-buried in the slime — were chests, broken remnants of structures, and ruins of something ancient, something unknown.

Hunjvo too afraid runs screaming and crying, fear has gotten the better of our friend. He won't listen to your command. Too bad, maybe next time Hunjvo. </> },
    { label: "It's nothing, head back home..", content: <>Hunjvo scared but determined, blinks and exhales a sigh of relief. “Next time, when I feel a bit braver and stronger,” he thought, retreating slowly, torchlight shaking in his hand. </> }

## Aftermath

He climbed back toward the fortress, empty-handed but haunted. The echoes of the cave followed him, whispering in the dark, tormenting him through sleepless nights. The mysteries beneath the mountain were waiting, and Hunjvo knew that one day, he would return to face the deep dark.

  prompt="But yet.. is Hunjvo still eager for some action? Some skeletons are under a small cavern covering. What do you do?"

    { label: "Let Hunjvo have some fun :) FIGHT!", content: <>Hunjvo unsure of what to do, looks around, but doesn't run away? Is he eager to prove he is brave yet again.. let's see what will happen. <AssetVideo name="d131_SkeletonBattle.mp4" /> </> },
    { label: "Let the skeletons have their tea party, continue your way back home..", content: <>Hunjvo stares down the skeleton party and yells "You don't scare me!" Both skeletons unaware of Hunjvo continue to discuss amongst each other on who has the shiniest bones. One of them has a golden helmet on, I think that one is the shiniest. </> }
