## Another Day Outside the Fortress

After many days rebuilding the Fortress of Fluffy Socks—patching walls, mining deep into the mountain, and reorganizing the food storage after the polar bear party—Hunjvo felt the itch to explore again. But this time, he didn’t wander far.

Near the village by his fortress, he spotted something extraordinary.

## Goie, go, go, Goie... not sure why Hunjvo choose this name. Do you know Goie?

A horse.
A great, majestic steed with a shimmering coat and proud stance.

Its name, Hunjvo decided instantly, was Goie.

## A Strange Item from the Village

The villagers, slowly growing accustomed to Hunjvo’s presence (and smell), gathered around. One of them shyly handed him a saddle. Hunjvo held it up, confused.

“What’s this?” he asked.

The villagers exchanged glances, muttered strange hand gestures, and backed away nervously. The clerics pinched their noses dramatically.

“Do you want me to put it on you?” Hunjvo asked one of the villagers, genuinely puzzled.

That was enough to send them running. No villager wanted to be anywhere near Hunjvo the Smelly—not after the clerics had loudly declared him “aromatically dangerous.”

## Guess This is How You Ride

But Hunjvo shrugged and turned to Goie.

The horse blinked once. Calm. Unbothered. Regal.

Hunjvo placed the saddle on Goie’s back.
Goie flicked his tail and—if Hunjvo wasn’t imagining it—whispered, “Hold on.”

And then they were off.

Hunjvo rode Goie around the Fortress of Fluffy Socks under the moonlight, wind rushing past, snow sparkling beneath their hooves. It was exhilarating, magical, and slightly terrifying because—

“HUNJVO, WHY ARE YOU RIDING AT NIGHT AGAIN?” the narrator cried.

But Hunjvo didn’t hear. He was too busy laughing, too busy enjoying the freedom of the ride, too busy trusting Goie’s steady gallop.

## Enough of Riding, it's Night! Head home..

Fortunately, the fortress was close by.
And soon, the night’s excitement faded into calm.

Hunjvo slid off Goie, patted his mane, and whispered, “Good horse.”

Goie blinked again, as if saying, “Anytime.”

Then Hunjvo trudged into his bunker, ready for sleep, dreaming of future adventures with his new majestic friend.
