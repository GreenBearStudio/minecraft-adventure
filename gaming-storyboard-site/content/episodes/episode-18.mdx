Hunjvo was wandering the countryside near the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, humming to himself and admiring the snowy peaks, when a brilliant idea struck him.

“A grand plan!” he shouted.
The narrator winced.
Oh no… what could go wrong this time?

Hunjvo puffed out his chest.
“I will create… a BIG ANIMAL PARTY HOUSE!”

The narrator blinked.
“…What could go wrong?”
(Everything. Absolutely everything.)

## Operation: Animal Chaos

Without hesitation, Hunjvo sprinted into the fields and forests, determined to gather every pig, sheep, and horse he could find.

There was only one problem.
He hadn’t built the house yet.
Not even a fence.
Not even a sign.

“Hunjvo… where are you going to put them?” the narrator asked, voice cracking.

But Hunjvo was already running around like a whirlwind, waving wheat at sheep, carrots at pigs, and saddles at horses. Animals followed him in a confused parade, bleating, oinking, and neighing as they trailed behind their chaotic shepherd.

## The Villagers Watch in Horror

The villagers peeked out from behind their houses, eyes wide.
There was Hunjvo, sprinting across the fields with a dozen animals chasing him like he was the Pied Piper of Fluffy Socks.

“Is he… leading them to us?” one villager whispered.
“Quick, inside!” another cried.
The clerics slammed their doors first, of course.

The narrator sighed.
Hopefully he won’t start leading the villagers too…

## The Grand Party House (…Eventually?)

By midday, Hunjvo had collected:

7 pigs

5 sheep

3 horses

1 confused cow who wasn’t sure why she was there

And still—no house.
Not even a wall.
Just Hunjvo standing in a field surrounded by animals staring at him expectantly.

“Hunjvo… maybe build the house first?” the narrator pleaded.

But Hunjvo just grinned, proud of his new fluffy, woolly, snorting army.

The villagers retreated into their homes, shaking their heads, wondering—yet again—what went on inside Hunjvo’s mind.

Probably best not to ask.
