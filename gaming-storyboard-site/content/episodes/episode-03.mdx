## Just Another Day, Building..

High above the snowy cliffs, Hunjvo balanced on the scaffolding of his ever-growing fortress. He wiped the frost from his brow and muttered cheerfully, “Just continuing to build the foundation of the great halls of the eastern wall. Nothing to worry about, well… just don’t look down, haha. A long way to go but great view, I like the waterfall :)”

## The Mysterious Sound of..?

Stone by stone, timber by timber, the fortress climbed higher. But as the walls rose, so did the impatience of the unseen narrator. The voice thundered across the peaks: “DO SOMETHING ELSE!”

Hunjvo froze, startled. He spun around, searching the ridges. Was it a zombie? An Illager? The villagers had warned him about those cruel raiders, whispering of stolen food and broken farms. His heart sank as he remembered the farmer’s sorrow. Too afraid to face such enemies, Hunjvo bolted down the mountain, his boots skidding across the snow.

## My new Friend.. Jibby

He ducked into a cave, torchlight flickering against the stone. His breath caught — only one zombie lurked in the shadows, slow and clumsy. But beside it fluttered a small bat, curious and unafraid.

Hunjvo smiled. “First cave with friendly bat :) I will call him Jibby. He will be my friend.”

<ChoiceBlock
  prompt="Do you pet the bat?"
  choices={[
    { label: "He's friendly, pet him", content: <>Hunjvo tries to get close and pet the bat. The bat squeaking, flies away..</> },
    { label: "Observe at a distance", content: <>The flapping motion of the bat, calms down the still beating scared heart of Hunjvo. The bat sqeaks "I'm a girl by the way.." Hunjvo confused thinking "Why am I hearing voices?"</> }

The bat squeaked, circling his torchlight like a tiny guardian. Hunjvo’s mind raced with plans. “Looking around, thinking will add this to my tunnel network later. Will come back for Jibby later, and build a palace for the bats. Need to find more bats… Jibby we will see each other again :)”

The zombie groaned, ignored. The bat fluttered, cherished. And Hunjvo, once again, found purpose not just in stone and timber, but in companionship. The Fortress of Fluffy Socks would rise higher still — but somewhere in its endless tunnels, a palace for bats was waiting to be carved.

## Watching the Sunset..

Hunjvo, happy and hungry. The narrator "HUNJVO go eat your carrot! I can't concentrate with your stomach growling!", Hunjvo thinking to himeself "I've gone crazy, but you are right, time to eat my carrot". 

Looking out in the sunset, Hunjvo wondered what adventures waited him next?
