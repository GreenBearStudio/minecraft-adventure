## The Calmness of Snow

The morning after his battle in the basement, Hunjvo longed for peace. He strolled through the valley below his fortress, the snow crunching under his boots, the sky clear and calm. For once, the world felt quiet.

## A new Snowy Vistor

Along the way, he encountered a polar bear. It lumbered forward, massive and white, but without a cub in sight. Hunjvo froze, heart pounding. The narrator whispered nervously, “That was a little scary.” But the bear only blinked at him, calm and curious.

Hunjvo grinned. “I’ll call you Happy, because you’re happy.”

## The Tunnel in the Valley

With new inspiration, he decided to dig a great tunnel connecting the lower valley to his mountain stronghold. “Better than falling into another deep dark cave,” he thought, recalling yesterday’s disaster. The work was steady, the snow soothing, and the daydreams plentiful.

Too plentiful.

## The Day was grea.. wait isn't it Night?

Night fell before Hunjvo realized it, and he found himself — of all places — inside a cave. The groans of the undead stirred behind him. Snapping out of his reverie, he sprinted toward the tunnel entrance, torchlight guiding his way back to safety.

But a zombie had followed. Its footsteps echoed, its growl rising. Hunjvo’s senses sharpened, his grip tightened on his sword. He spun, poised for battle.

Steel met rotting flesh. The clash was brief, decisive. With a final strike, the zombie fell, its groans silenced.

Hunjvo stood victorious, breathing hard, torchlight flickering against the stone. He wiped his brow and muttered, “Relaxing day… maybe too relaxing. Next time, I’ll keep an eye on the sun.”

  <Choice label="Stare.."> 
    Hunjvo and Happy engaged in a staring contest.. not knowing who will win. What seemed like hours, Hunjvo was staring to sweet, his eyes unable to blink, finally gave up. "You are too good at that, Happy" exhaled Hunjvo. Happy confused, thinking "Why was he looking at me like that? Minecraft players are so strange", before walking away into the snow.

Above, the Fortress of Fluffy Socks waited, and somewhere in the valley, Happy the polar bear roamed — a reminder that even in a world of danger, friendship could be found in the snow.
