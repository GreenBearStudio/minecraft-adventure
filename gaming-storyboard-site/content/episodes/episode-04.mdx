## A Prologue to an Unfortunate Fall

<AssetVideo name="d90_WalkingAround.mp4" />

Looking around his mountain fortress, Hunjvo admired the waterfall cascading down the cliffs. It shimmered in the torchlight, beautiful and full of mystery. Beside it, a cave yawned open, equally dangerous.

“Soon I’ll explore that cave and see what lies in the shadows! Zombies, I will come for you!” he thought boldly. Yet fate had other plans. Hunjvo would soon see the inside of the cave — not by choice, but by clumsiness.

## An Unseen Adventu.. what oh no!

The voice of the narrator "Hunjvo what are you doing?". Hunjvo squeezed through a narrow gap beneath his fortress, humming to himself, minding his own business, looking for a good spot to mine. “What a niceeeee…” he began, when suddenly his footing slipped.

“Ahhhh—AHH—AHHaa—!”

Splat.

Hunjvo groaned, still alive but battered, his health down to just two and a half hearts. He blinked, torch flickering, and realized he had landed in the middle of a cavern. Shadows stirred. A creeper hissed nearby, zombies shuffled closer, their groans echoing off the stone.

“Oh no… oh no no no!” Hunjvo panicked, scrambling to his feet. He darted around, searching desperately for an escape. Then he saw it — a waterfall spilling down from above, shimmering like salvation.

And then, a voice. Calm, mysterious, echoing through the cavern: “Swim. Swim up the waterfall.”

Hunjvo didn’t question it. He plunged into the rushing water, clawing upward, lungs burning, zombies groaning below. The current pulled at him, but he fought, climbing higher and higher until at last he burst out into the snowy air.

## A Bit of Calm

He collapsed on the ground, gasping, his hearts slowly healing back to normal. The fortress of Fluffy Socks loomed above, ridiculous and reassuring.

“Haha… barely made it. Note to self: don’t squeeze through random gaps again.”

The waterfall roared behind him, the cave whispered its dangers, and the mysterious voice of Noor lingered in his mind. The mountain held secrets, and Hunjvo knew he had only just begun to uncover them.

The narrator, getting up from his couch, quickly turns to the screen "What.. the story continues?! Hunjvo, look out!"

## Epilogue: The Battle Under the Fortress

The torches sputtered in the basement of the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, shadows stretching across the stone walls. Hunjvo crept along the corridor, patrolling the lower levels, when a chilling sound echoed — the creak of a bowstring.

From the darkness, a Stray skeleton emerged, its icy bones rattling, eyes glowing faintly blue. With eerie precision, it loosed a volley of arrows tipped with slowness.

One struck Hunjvo squarely in the butt.

“Oww!” he yelped, stumbling forward, clutching his backside. His legs felt heavy, his movements sluggish. The Stray hissed, drawing again.

Hunjvo spun around, fury rising. “You picked the wrong basement!” he shouted, charging forward despite the slowness dragging at his limbs.

The Stray retreated, firing arrow after arrow. One grazed his shoulder, another clattered against the wall. Hunjvo ducked behind a pillar, heart pounding, then lunged out with his sword. Steel clashed against bone, sparks flying as the blade struck the Stray’s bow.

The Stray staggered, hissing, and swung its icy bones like a club. Hunjvo blocked, the impact rattling his arms. He knew that was running out of time before more showed up, Hunjvo needed to run or fight..

The Stray was relentless. It notched another arrow, and fired straight at Hunjvo’s chest. He twisted, the arrow grazing past, embedding into the wall.

"NOW" yelled Hunjvo. With a roar, he closed the distance. He swung his sword in a wide arc, cleaving through the Stray’s skull. The skeleton collapsed into a heap of frozen bones, its bow clattering uselessly to the stone.

Breathless, Hunjvo leaned against the wall, his hearts flickering low but steady. He looked down at the shattered remains and muttered, “Next time… aim somewhere else.”

The basement fell silent once more, save for the crackle of torches. The Fortress of Fluffy Socks had survived another threat — but Hunjvo knew the mountain was far from done testing him.
