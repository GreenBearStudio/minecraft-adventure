## Time to Head Back

After many long days of wandering, fighting, running, and occasionally screaming, Hunjvo finally returned home to the Fortress of Fluffy Socks. What an adventure he had survived — drifting down rivers crawling with zombies, dodging skeleton arrows, swatting at spiders, and sprinting away from witches who cackled far too loudly for Hunjvo’s comfort.

He had visited not one but two villages:
- the snowy village, where Smally lived
- the taiga village, where he… borrowed (ate) all their food

Hopefully, someday, the villagers would forgive him.
Hopefully, the iron golem would give him a flower next time.
Hopefully, it wouldn’t stare at him with glowing red eyes, ready to pounce.

But for now — Hunjvo was home.

## Happy, happy, happy.. and Flippy?!

Happy the polar bear greeted him with a cheerful grunt, and beside him stood a new friend: a smaller polar bear Hunjvo immediately named Flippy. Together, the three of them looked out over the horizon, admiring the snowy peaks, the forests below, and the ever‑growing silhouette of the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.

Later that day, Hunjvo got right back to work. He patched walls, expanded tunnels, added new towers, and placed torches everywhere (sometimes too many torches, but better safe than sorry). As he worked, he dreamed of the future.

“Maybe someday,” he thought, “my fortress will be full of life! Maybe villagers will come live here and we’ll make a grand village together!”

But first… he had to convince the nearby villagers that he wasn’t dangerous.

He had met them several times, but the clerics always eyed him suspiciously. They whispered among themselves:

“He smells like rotten flesh.”
“He eats rotten flesh.”
“He likes rotten flesh.”
“He has never brewed a potion in his life!”

The narrator and the clerics yelled in unison:
“Eek! Hunjvo, that is NOT right! Eat some bread, you stinky guy!”

Hunjvo shrugged, munched on a piece of rotten zombie flesh, then took a bite of bread to balance it out.
“See? Healthy,” he said proudly.

Despite his questionable diet, he continued helping the villagers expand their own settlement. He dug paths, built bridges, and even started planning a road that would one day connect the village directly to the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.

Maybe soon — if he behaved, if he didn’t steal food, and if he stopped smelling like the undead — the villagers might actually want to visit his fortress.

Well… hopefully nicely.
