## Another Adventure beyond the Fortress

After many days of travel by boat and on foot, Hunjvo entered a snowy biome. The cold bit at his cheeks, but he was used to it — his mountain fortress was no stranger to icy winds. Looking back, he thought of the lake, the oak trees, and the familiar village near his home. Ahead lay new adventure.

He packed his belongings from the boat and trudged into the snow. Soon, he stumbled upon a friendly snowy village.

## The Snowy Village of Laughter and Hugs

The villagers greeted him warmly, throwing a grand party in his honor. Laughter filled the air.

And many villagers gossiped and discussed the strange new hero, called Hunjvo.

## Smally, the new kid.. who didn't like Hunjvo

Love and laughter was everywhere. And a new villager kid appeared!

Smally. But Smally grew frightened of Hunjvo’s strange ways and darted into his house. One by one, the villagers followed, slamming doors and shuttering windows. Hunjvo blinked, confused. “Did I do something wrong?” he wondered.

## Under Attack!

Then — an arrow whizzed past his ear. Frozen skeletons were approaching, their icy bows drawn. That was what had scared the villagers.

Hunjvo looked around. Too many. He did what he did best: RUN!

He dashed into the food store, heart pounding, hoping the undead wouldn’t find him. But another danger lurked inside — his stomach. The shelves were stacked with the snowy villagers’ food reserves, and hunger gnawed at him.

## Too much food! Hunjvo hold on, this is the villagers' food! Hunj...

Before long, Hunjvo was devouring everything in sight — bread, berries, dried fish, even the candy hidden in the corner. Smally’s cookie, carefully tucked away, was gone in a single sloppy bite.

Poor Smally. He would never taste his cookie. And Hunjvo, crumbs on his face, sat in the dark store chewing noisily, unaware of the trouble he had just caused.

## The Night of Terror

The frozen skeletons prowled outside, the villagers hid in fear, and the snowy village’s food reserves were gone. When morning came, how would they react to their guest — the builder of fortresses, the slayer of zombies, and now… the eater of all their food?

    The sounds were getting louder! Hunjvo was scared, but he looked up and the sun was comming up over the snowy trees! Soon the shrieks were gone and replaced with the smell of bones being burnt. That was close.

The sun came out, and Hunjvo and the villagers were happy yet again. While the villagers were throwing another party, Hunjvo packed his bags and headed back home, thinking "maybe I should call this the Party Village? Well time to head home". And so Hunjvo sat on his boat and started to paddle back to his fortress of Fluffyness.
