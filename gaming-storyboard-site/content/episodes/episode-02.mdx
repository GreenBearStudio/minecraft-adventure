## Getting more Food

Hunjvo finished scouring the farm, clutching beets, carrots, and a loaf of bread as if they were treasures. He strapped on a pair of worn leather boots to keep from slipping into the snow, and with grim determination, set out to carve a bunker high in the frozen peaks.

Days blurred into nights as he labored, sleepless and wary of the creatures that prowled outside. The howls of zombies echoed through the valleys, and the rattling bones of skeletons clattered against the icy stone. Fear kept him inside, but hunger kept him alive.

## Tunnels, Tunnels, and more yes Tunnels

He began chiseling tunnels deep into the mountain, weaving a hidden network beneath the snow. Each passage was a gamble, each torch a fragile flame against the dark. The tunnels were not just escape routes — they were the veins of a growing dream.

## A Slightly Weird name?

No longer content with hiding, Hunjvo began construction of his citadel. He named it Fortress of Fluffy Socks — a joke to himself, a reminder that even in the coldest nights, warmth and absurdity could be weapons. Timber walls rose, stone towers took shape, and the snowy peaks echoed with the sound of defiance.

The undead grew restless. Skeletons clattered at the gates, zombies moaned in the valleys. Hunjvo watched from his battlements, torchlight flickering against the snow. His tunnels allowed him to strike and vanish, a phantom in the peaks. The fortress held, and the legend of Fluffy Socks spread among survivors who whispered of a man who turned fear into laughter.

But as the fortress grew, so too did the tunnels. They twisted and branched endlessly, a labyrinth of stone and torchlight. Hunjvo often found himself wandering in circles, lost in the very network he had built. Yet he never despaired. With pickaxe in hand and determination in his heart, he pressed on — mining, crafting, and expanding. For in the snowy peaks, even if he lost his way, he knew the Fortress of Fluffy Socks would always stand as proof that survival could be ridiculous, and ridiculousness could be legendary.
