Hunjvo couldn’t stop thinking about the portal of purple whispers. Its swirling obsidian frame, its strange hum, its mysterious treasure box… it all tugged at his curiosity. So one morning, he grabbed his pickaxe, packed some bread (and yes, some rotten flesh too), and marched back toward the abandoned portal.

He wasn’t planning anything dangerous this time.
No fighting Strays.
No running in circles.
No screaming.

He just wanted some netherrack because, in his words, “It looks cool and glowy and I want it.”

When he reached the portal, the purple mist shimmered faintly, whispering secrets he pretended not to hear. Hunjvo chipped away at the netherrack happily, humming as he collected block after block.

Then he saw it.

A warm glow.
A flicker of orange.
A tiny bubbling sound.

Nestled beside the portal, half-hidden under snow and stone, was a block of lava.

Hunjvo gasped.
His eyes sparkled.
His brain stopped working for a moment.

“LAVA!” he shouted, jumping up and down like a child who found a rare candy.

He sprinted back to the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, nearly tripping twice, and burst into his crafting room. With great determination, he smelted iron, hammered pieces together, and proudly crafted an iron bucket.

He held it up like a legendary artifact.
“Great.”

Then he ran all the way back to the portal, scooped up the lava with a triumphant grin, and held the bucket high above his head.

The portal hummed softly, as if amused.
The netherrack glowed.
And Hunjvo, now the proud owner of a bucket of lava, marched home with the confidence of a hero who had just conquered the world.

Little did he know… this single bucket would soon become the heart of his great foundry at the Fortress of Fluffy Socks.

But that is a story for another day.
