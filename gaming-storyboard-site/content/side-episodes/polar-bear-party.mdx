One chilly afternoon at the Fortress of Fluffy Socks, Happy the polar bear decided it was time for a celebration. After all, Hunjvo had been away for days, and the fortress felt far too quiet. So Happy invited his new friend Flippy… and Flippy invited everyone else.

Soon, polar bears from every snowy ridge and frozen riverbank lumbered up the mountain. Big ones, small ones, fluffy ones, grumpy ones — all ready for a grand polar bear party.

They pushed open the fortress gates (which were definitely not polar‑bear‑proof) and waddled inside. At first, they behaved. They sniffed around politely. They admired the torches. They even sat in a circle for a moment, humming bear noises.

Then they found Hunjvo’s food storage.

Chaos erupted.

Polar bears tore into barrels of fish, stacks of bread, piles of berries, and anything that smelled remotely edible. They knocked over crates, rolled around in wheat, and even tried to eat Hunjvo’s emergency pumpkin pies.

Flippy, curious and adventurous, discovered Hunjvo’s chest of valuables.
Inside: copper ingots, gold bars, and a few shiny nuggets.

The bears sniffed them.
They licked them.
They bit them.

CLONK.

“Ow,” grunted one bear, rubbing its jaw.

The bears collectively decided the shiny things were bad food. So they tossed them out the window. Down the mountain. Into the snow.

Satisfied, they returned to the party.

Just then, Hunjvo arrived home, humming happily as he walked through the fortress gates. The polar bears froze. Every single one of them turned toward him with the exact same guilty smile — wide, innocent, and absolutely suspicious.

Hunjvo blinked.
The bears blinked back.

Then, as soon as he stepped into the bunker where his bed was, the entire herd bolted. They scrambled out the doors, down the mountain, slipping and sliding as they fled the scene of the crime.

When Hunjvo came back upstairs, the fortress was a disaster. Food gone. Barrels smashed. Wheat everywhere. And his copper and gold… missing.

Happy and Flippy peeked from behind a snowbank outside, smiling nervously.

Hunjvo sighed.
“Polar bears… why?”

But he couldn’t stay mad. After all, it was a very fluffy party.
