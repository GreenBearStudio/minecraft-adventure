## Original Purpose of the Project

A diary of Hunjvo's Minecraft adventures that he decided to share with others
(well maybe at the will of the unseen narrator). Hunjvo hopes his adventures will
inspire you to create your own and make some friends along the way.

## Some technical specifications and notes for those interested...

This site is built as a modular publishing pipeline for gaming storyboards. Each episode 
is written in MDX with frontmatter metadata, making it easy to version, extend, and
diagnose.

The goal is to explore narrative design, gameplay mechanics, and creative flows in a
reproducible format. By combining Next.js, MDX, typescript, CSS, and reusable components, 
we can embed images, videos, and interactive flows directly into each episode.

Built with extensibility in mind, the pipeline ensures that new episodes can be added
simply by dropping a file into <code>content/episodes/</code>. The homepage and
navigation update automatically, keeping the site future‑proof and easy to maintain.
