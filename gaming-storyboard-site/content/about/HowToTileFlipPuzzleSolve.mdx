## 🧩 The Tile-Flip Puzzle

The Tile‑Flip Puzzle looks simple at first glance — tap a tile, and it flips along with its neighbors.  
But beneath that simplicity is a surprisingly elegant little system.

Here’s how to approach it:

---

### 🔹 1. Understand the Flip Pattern  
Each tap flips **five tiles**:

- the tile you tapped  
- the tile above  
- the tile below  
- the tile to the left  
- the tile to the right  

This creates a **plus‑shaped pattern** of changes.

Your goal is to make **all tiles turn dark**.

---

### 🔹 2. Work From the Top Down  
A classic strategy is to solve the puzzle **row by row**:

1. Start at the top row.  
2. If a tile is lit, tap the tile **directly below it**.  
3. This turns off the tile above without disturbing rows you’ve already fixed.

By the time you reach the bottom row, the entire upper grid will be stable.

---

### 🔹 3. Fix the Bottom Row Carefully  
Once only the bottom row remains:

- Tap tiles in the **second‑to‑last row** to correct the bottom row.  
- Each tap affects the tile above and the tile below, so you can “push” the pattern into place.

If the bottom row ends up unsolvable, don’t worry — that just means the starting pattern was tricky.  
Reset and try again with the same top‑down method.

### 🔹 4. Use Symmetry to Your Advantage  
If the puzzle looks symmetrical:

- Try tapping tiles in symmetrical positions  
- Often, mirrored moves cancel out unwanted flips  
- This reduces the number of moves dramatically

---

### 🔹 5. Don’t Be Afraid to Experiment  
The puzzle is designed to be **playful**, not punishing.

- Try tapping corners  
- Try tapping the center  
- Watch how patterns ripple across the grid  

You’ll start to see the puzzle as a system rather than a set of random lights.

### 🔹 6. Celebrate the Unlock  
Once every tile is dark, the puzzle is solved — and the hidden content will appear:

### 🧠 Tip  
If you ever feel stuck, try this simple rule:

> **Tap every lit tile, but only once.**

It’s not always optimal, but it’s surprisingly effective.

Happy puzzling!
